Initially viewing knowledge as a universal right, the galactic empire's bureaucrats coveted this newfound technology, perceiving it as a means to assert their dominance as a superior civilization. When the alien species refused to exclusively surrender their research to the empire, what was recorded as a great war was, in truth, a genocide orchestrated by the galactic empire. The aim was to pilfer the Novoro research, a covert operation that succeeded in stealing fragments, yet the full investigation remains incomplete even after centuries. Despite ongoing efforts, the device capable of altering matter's composition remains non-functional, rendering the Novoro element unusable. The galactic empire persists in unraveling the mystery behind Novoro, while their adversaries, the Xuras, relentlessly attempt to pilfer the incomplete research. The Xuras' existence remains shrouded in secrecy, shielded from the galactic empire's populace by an efficient defense system, making them an unknown threat kept under governmental wraps."})]})]})]})}};
