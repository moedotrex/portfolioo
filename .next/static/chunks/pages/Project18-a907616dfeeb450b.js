When the alien species refused to exclusively surrender their research to the empire, what was recorded as a great war was, in truth, a genocide orchestrated by the galactic empire. The aim was to pilfer the Novoro research, a covert operation that succeeded in stealing fragments, yet the full investigation remains incomplete even after centuries.

The galactic empire persists in unraveling the mystery behind Novoro, while their adversaries, the Xuras, relentlessly attempt to pilfer the incomplete research.
